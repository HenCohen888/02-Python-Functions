#The program should:
#Ask the user for two numbers, let’s call them a and b.

#Show a menu with options:
#a) print the biggest divider
#(we’ll clarify in a second what that means)
#b) print the smallest divider
#c) print pow(a, b) (that means 
#d) print sqrt(a) - sqrt(b)
#e) exit the program

#The user can choose options until they pick e (exit).
#So this is an interactive menu loop.
